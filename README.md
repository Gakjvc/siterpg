# siterpg
A (initially) small website made for an RPG game.

This site should serve as a kind of central hub/ main menu for players looking to join. 
It shall also be where those in play can check their progress and look into more information about their peers (or foes).

All of this in a medieval guild aesthetic, following the DND system; I'll try to keep things as diegetic (in universe, as if a magic poster on the wall of a guild tavern) as possible.
